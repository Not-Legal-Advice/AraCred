# AraCred

Please see the [AraCred Deployment page](https://aracred.github.io/website/docs/deploymentOverview/) for info on how to setup and run AraCred.

> Note! AraCred does **not** run on the master branch of SourceCred. It runs on the [SourceCred Discord branch](https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/tree/discord), which at the time of writing, is experimental. As such, expect things to break early and often. 

# About This Instance

An [AraCred](https://aracred.github.io/website/) experiment to give people tokens based on not giving out legal advice.

Currently this runs [AraCred](https://aracred.github.io/website/docs/aracred) on the [LexDAO GitHub repos](https://github.com/lexDAO/). This runs [SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io/) to CredRank (like [PageRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank), but for contributions) people's contributions and then mint a proportional amount of tokens in the [NLA DAO](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/notlegaladvice/home/).

Eventually this will also be connected to the [LexDAO Discord](https://discord.gg/Eds87c7) to CredRank chats.
